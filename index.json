However, most of existing methods only superficially portrayed the low layer features without considering the uneven distribution of information, which is insufficient because stereo image warping and sub-pixel upsampling require discriminative features to identify corresponding pixels. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel network named Non-local Nested Residual Attention Network (NNRANet). Specifically, a non-local dilated attention module (NDAM) is developed to exploit the rich hierarchical feature and capture the longrange dependencies between pixels. Moreover, we present a nested residual group (NRG) with dense connections and multiple nested residual sub-network, which not only continuously remembers and extracts the stereo fusion feature, but also enables training a deeper and more stable network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Middlebury, KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets.","tags":null,"title":"[ICASSP 2020] Non-local Nested Residual Attention Network For Stereo Image Super-resolution","type":"publication"}]
